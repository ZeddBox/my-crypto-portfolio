💎 Made with Rails 6
Initialization with Kickoff_Tailwind : https://github.com/justalever/kickoff_tailwind

💻 With CoinMarketCap API

## Presentation

Connect to my website and see all the cryptocurrencies available on the market. You can see prices in time.

With this website you can add all the previous and future purchases for cryptocurrencies. This is not a wallet, only a trace of your purchases that you add manually.
With this portfolio you'll see your total amount invested and now with market prices.

## Next Features

- See your total amount with graphiques
- See how many $ you'll get if you sell XX% of a cryptocurrency you own at $XX now or in the future.
